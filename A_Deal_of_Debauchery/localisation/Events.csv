"dd_italya_desc;Ever since 1685, the Mamluks have had control of Southern Italy, forwarding their agenda of Muslim control in the Two Sicilies. In response to this, the Habsburg Monarchy had solidified their control of Northern Italy, instuting a rule of Catholicism in their lands and their puppet state of Greater Pisa. Now, the peninsula is on the precipice of war, with conflict brewing ever since the recent Continental Wars where the Muslim invaders thoroughly defeated Leopold VIII of House Habsburg and his forces. Will Italy remain divided by their religion, will unification occur despite religious conflicts, or will one side spill heathen blood to unify? Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;"
